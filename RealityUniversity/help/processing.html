	 The user simply presses the 'Save and Process Surveys' button<br> 
	 in the Survey Form page to start up the processing.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Processing is done within the application, so there's no need<br>
     for survey volunteers to make judgement calls on the survey data.<br>
     This helps to expedite the data entry process as manual data entry<br>
     and processing is very time and labor intensive.

	 Student Data is stored in an embedded database also within the application.<br>
	 The application allows admins to go in and make changes to it via GUI interfaces.<br>
	 For example, if one wishes to add/delete jobs and related information, then<br>
	 one can certainly do that within the Settings panel.
	 </p> 
      	 
     <p>
     In case the database gets deleted, which can happen, the application when opening up<br>
     will check for all data tables. If it finds one missing, then it will recreate it<br>
     from a backup file.
